Our project is based on the 2018 paper [Transcriptome and DNA methylome reveal insights into yield heterosis in the curds of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var. italic)](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-018-1384-4?fbclid=IwAR3glcIlScIMQzxMjWtuaDowqrv7DlZbzAjrTAiHRlXkRfWdyfWgt_BqCW4).

Proposal
--------

The following proposal is meant to give an outline of our project with an introduction, objectives, description of the data, proposed major analysis, and a breakdown of assigned tasks.

### Abstract

Hybrid vigour or heterosis is the improved quality or trait in the offspring as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. As an illustration, brocoli have flowers that pack densely to form the head which is the main edible part of the plant. When breeding disimillar strains of brocoli their offspring can form much larger heads of brocoli as demonstrated by figure 1.

![Brocoli heterosis](https://scontent.fyka1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/49213408_10218077757916241_2440798217458155520_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent.fyka1-1.fna&oh=d67a2a1ec54157595a7320d8cbed3bc3&oe=5CFB074F).

Figure 1. Hybrid vigour demonstrated by the larger head size of the hybrid offspring in comparison to the parents.

In order to explore the genetic and methylomic basis of this phenomenon as well as the contribution from each parent we will be analyzing RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) data from Li et al. (2018) from parent and offspring brocoli that exhbited hybrid vigour. The data transcriptomic and methylomic data associated with this paper can be found [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12870-018-1384-4/MediaObjects/12870_2018_1384_MOESM2_ESM.zip).

<We will first explore the data through graphical visulaization, for example heat maps of RNA seq data. After that to compare the different gene expressions and epigenetic characteristics we will use ANOVA or analysis of variance for parental and hybrid offspring data.> --&gt; Gary and Glenn??? maybe add more
